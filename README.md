# Aadhar card detection using YOLO

Aadhar card detection uisng YOLO is a deep learning approach that employs YOLO, a flawless object detection algorithm that can achieve state of art results. In this project we have fine tuning the YOLOv5 algorithm on a custom dataset of aadhar cards consisting of 813 images shot at different angles, in different backgrounds, and under different lightning conditions. The approach to object detection using YOLO was introduced in the paper 'You Only Look Once' by Joseph Redmon in 2016 at the CVPR conference.
